\section{RESTful Introduction}

Since 1999, RESTful communication protocols have taken the web by storm. In the past few years, the web has moved towards using WebSockets, which enable bidirectional client-server communication. In this design specification, we compare the once-wildly popular RESTful communication protocol with alternate protocol buffers used to serialize data passed via WebSockets. Our comparison of these communication protocols is substantiated through a discussion of the results of implementing a web application to facilitate online chat between users and groups using each of these communication protocols. 


\subsection{Interfaces Under Scrutiny}

For our RESTful application, a server and client communicate over HTTP get and post requests. On the client side, these requests are decoded in JavaScript; on the server side, these requests are decoded in Python; they are then dispatched as select, update, insert, or delete SQL requests. 

\subsection{Assumed Environment}

For our RESTful application, the client's environment must have access to HTTP passed over port 8080 and must be able to run JavaScript. The server must likewise be able to access HTTP passed over port 8080, via an HTTPServer library. The server must also run Python.

\section{RESTful Design}

\subsection{High Frequency Polling} 

%TODO: JUSTIFICATION FOR WHY WE CHOSE THIS METHOD 

 In implementing our web chat application using the REST-ful communication protocol, we opted for a high frequency polling approach, wherein the client opens a webpage which initiates frequent, constant communication with the server by means of a series of GET requests. 
 
We extend the high frequency polling approach to include a success handshake so as to confirm message receipt. In this way, if a message send operation is unsuccessful, we retry sending the message.

%TODO: INSERT DIAGRAM EXPLAINING THIS INTERACTION

 This high frequency polling approach operates as follows: 

\begin{itemize}
\item The client opens a webpage which initiates a GET request using AJAX. This GET request is open until one of the following occur: (a) a success response is received or (b) an error response is received. 
\item In either (a) or (b), a completion script runs in which the AJAX request is dispatched again after a set amount of time. In the case of (a), there is no delay; in the case of (b), there is a 1000 millisecond delay. 
\item The server receives the GET request. It looks up messages for the particular client, based on a cookie passed in the request header, and sends an unread message back to the client, along with a success response. Further, the server sends the ids of the message returned in the response header. Lastly, the server updates the MySQL database of messages to indicate that this message is currently being sent. 
\item On (a), the success response, the client receives a message to display and an id corresponding to that message from the MySQL database. The client then dispatches an additional GET request containing the id of the message. 
\item On receiving the second confirmation GET request, the server updates the MySQL database to indicate that the message corresponding to a particular id has been received. 
\item If the server does not receive a success response a minute after sending a message, on the next client-initiated GET message corresponding to a request for new messages, the server updates the MySQL database to indicate that the formerly sent message was not received. 
\end{itemize} 

\subsection{Resources ``Conserved''} 

Without using WebSockets, which break the RESTful design paradigm, it is not possible to establish a persistent connection between client and server using HTTP. The implications of this are that it isn't possible for a RESTful application to have server-driven events. Hence, in order to create a low-latency application, a polling technique wherein the client repeatedly requests information from the server is necessary. Our approach of high frequency polling, while sub-ideal in comparison to a multi-threaded long-polling approach, results in a fairly low-latency chat application. 

We further limit the number of polling requests made by decreasing the frequency of those requests in response to HTTP error responses received; we achieve this by adding a time delay before allowing the client to query the server following an error response. 

\subsection{Resources ``Wasted''}

This RESTful application could be improved to conserve CPU usage by implementing a procedure of long polling, via multiple threads running on the server, in place of its current high frequency polling procedure. Further, the overhead used to implement high frequency polling is wasteful, as HTTP headers are repeatedly passed between server and client. While this would likewise be true of long polling, the number of requests would be curbed substantially. 

Further, in order to create a chat application, having both server and client-driven events would conserve resources such as CPU and decrease latency, as instead of requiring the client to continually request updates from the server, updates could be automatically routed both to and from the server on reception via bidirectional communication. This could be achieved by using WebSockets, a technique which is becoming increasingly popular on the Internet for communication problems of this variety. 

An additional resource wastage occurs in our continual passing of HTTP headers between server and client. Beyond continual passing of HTTP headers, we also continually pass JSON-encoded data between the client and server in response to GET and POST requests. While our headers and data sizes are quite minimal, this is nonetheless wasteful with respect to the amount of data which could be transmitted for such an application in theory. The number of passes of headers could be limited by using long polling instead of high frequency polling. Further, it would be unwise to remove the aspect of state transfer data altogether. 

\subsection{Failure Conditions}

Our system is subject to the following failure models: failstops, crashes, and byzantine failures: 

\begin{itemize} 
\item Failstops

% A processor fails by halting. Once it halts, the processor remains in that state. The fact that a processor has failed is detectable by other processors [S84].

A failstop could occur in our system when the client submits an HTTP request to the server when the server has halted. This will result in a connection refused error, which informed the client of the server's failure. 

\item Crashes

A crash could occur in our system when the client submits an HTTP request to the server when the server is initially online to receive this request. If the server then crashes before responding to the client, the client continually waits for a response from the server, with no knowledge that this failure has occurred. This crash could be circumvented by using a timeout procedure, wherein the client abandons a request after some amount of time. However, this fault tolerance would raise additional questions about the stability of the system, as the server may have already dispatched the data received from the client to the database, and reflecting this state would become complex. 

% A processor fails by halting. Once it halts, the processor remains in that state. The fact
% that a processor has failed may not be detectable by other processors [F83].
\item Byzantine Failures 

The correctness of our code is unproven, so while we are unaware of where a byzantine failure may occur, we recognize that such a failure is theoretically possible in our system. 

\item Receive, send, and general omissions
% A processor fails by receiving only a subset of the messages that have been
% sent to it or by halting and remaining halted [PT86].

%A processor fails by receiving only a subset of the messages that have been
%sent to it, by transmitting only a subset of the messages that it actually attempts send, and/or by
%halting and remaining halted [PT86].

A receive, send, or general omission could occur in our system when a client dispatches an HTTP request to the server, the client awaits an HTTP response. If the server does not receive this message, as by a lossy network, the client then awaits the response. Likewise, if the server receives the message and dispatches a response but, as by a lossy network, the client does not receive the response, the client continues to await the response.

\section{Protocol Buffer Introduction}

Protocol Buffers are an efficient way of serializing structured data, providing similar functionality as XML but in a faster and more robust package. By defining the structure of your data once, you can read and write your structured data in a variety of different languages and data streams. Using this technology, we built a chat application using \textit{Meteor}. 

\section{Interfaces Being Looked At}

%Interfaces: For our RESTful application, a server and client communicate over HTTP get and post requests. On the client side, these requests are decoded in JavaScript; on the server side, these requests are decoded in Python; they are then dispatched as select, update, or delete SQL requests.

The client and server communicate over HTTP by sending serialized data. All requests on both the client and server are encoded / decoded using JavaScript, as Meteor runs the same JavaScript code for both parties. 

\section{Assumed Environment}

%Environment: For our RESTful application, the client's environment must have access to HTTP passed over port 8080 and must be able to run JavaScript. The server must likewise be able to access HTTP passed over port 8080, via an HTTPServer library. The server must also run Python.

The client and server must have access to HTTP passed over a port (3000 is the default one we use) and must be able to run JavaScript. Furthermore, the server needs to have \href{https://www.npmjs.com/}{npm} and \href{https://www.meteor.com/}{Meteor} installed.

\section{System Design}

%\section*{Tianyu's Transcription}
%We want to replace JSON communication layer with protocol buffers. IN order to do that, we dig down into Meteor's implementation. There's  a package called ddp-common that handle's communication across sockets. we want to replace JSON communication layer with protocol buffers by replacing 2 methods inside utility.js. Those 2 methods are parse\_ddp() and stringify\_ddp(), which currently only rely on JSON. There is a very major complication here because the entire Meteor framework will assume that objects being passed around through sockets are JSON objects, so we actually need to have another layer of abstraction that takes a JSON object and converts that into a protocol buffer object, and then we serialize it. The implementation for that part is being done in json\_protocol.js. In json\_protocol.js, we manually define the protocol buffer abstraction for Javascript objects, which includes the majority of basic types, including integer, double, string, boolean, null, array, and object; array and object can actually have nested properties within. One thing that's annoying is that we cannot use npm\_require for Meteor because npm\_require will fail on the front end. Since ddp-common is a package that will be required on the front-end and the back-end, we will need to find a way to include all the packages without relying on npm\_require. That's non-trivial because ProtocolBufferJS is actually wrapped as a Node module. The way we solved this is take down the source files, manually import them into the directory, and remove all the npm\_require statements. So we pretty much just have a manual dependency tree by including files in a certain sequence. 
%
%If we were to do this again, we would actually use Node.js because so many of the functions rely on the objects being JSON objects, so our freedom is actually very limited. 
%
%All the implementation is inside utility.js and you can see that when it's deserializing, it's literally taking the string message and calling json\_protocol\_parse(); when serializing, you do json\_protoify(copy), where copy is a copy of the original question. After you serialize the entire thing, the entire thing will be converted into a hex string, meaning the actual data being sent over the wire is much, much smaller. This is especially useful when doing intense database operations like creating new lists. 
%
%TODO: search by user wildcard (Tianyu will do it after midnight), list users on the page where you create a new group, alert() that pops up when you mess up creating a new group.
%
%It's worth serializing on the bottom level because the operation you do at every single step will be converted into a comprehensive message package that contains like who's doing the action and what kind of action is it. 

Our system was mainly built using \textit{Meteor}, the popular JavaScript app framework, because the same code runs on the client and the server, it ports really easily to iOS and Android, and has a highly reactive GUI thanks to the Blaze framework. In order to integrate Protocol Buffers into \textit{Meteor}, we had to dig into its implementation files and modify the package, called \textit{ddp-common}, responsible for \textit{Meteor's} JSON communication. In this package is a file called \textit{utils.js} which contains the functions \textbf{parseDDP()} and \textbf{stringifyDDP()}, both of which only rely on JSON. The implication here is that the entire \textit{Meteor} framework assumes objects are being passed around as JSON objects, so we had to create another layer of abstraction that takes a JSON object, converts it into a Protocol Buffer object, and then serializes it. The implementation for this is done in \textbf{json\_proto.js}: we manually define the Protocol Buffer abstraction for JavaScript objects, including the basics types (integer, double, string, boolean, etc.), arrays, and objects (the latter 2 can have nested properties within). 

One snag we ran into is that we couldn't use npm's \textbf{require()} statements because Meteor would ignore them on the front-end. Since \textit{ddp-common} is used on the front-end and the back-end, we had to find a way to include all relevant packages without relying on \textbf{require()}. The way we did this is by saving all the source files, manually importing them into the directory, and removing all \textbf{require()} statements in our code. In essence, we created a manual dependency tree by including files in a certain sequence. 

Back to \textit{utils.js}, we see custom serialization being done with \textbf{JSONproto.protoify()} and deserialization with \textbf{JSONproto.parse()}. After serialization, the data is converted to a hex string, much fewer bytes are sent over the wire. This is incredibly useful when doing intense database operations and one of the main benefits of using Protocol Buffers.

\section{Resources Conserved}

\textit{Meteor} relies on 2 technologies for keeping the DOM up-to-date with the server: \textit{Blaze}, a declarative library for creating live-updating, reactive user experiences; and \textit{DDP}, a simple protocol for fetching structured data from a server and receiving live updates when data changes (basically REST for web sockets). Because these technologies are built straight into \textit{Meteor}, we minimize the number of requests flowing between the client and the server.

Furthermore, Protocol Buffers offer us a number of other benefits. When compared to XML, Protocol Buffers are 3 - 10 times smaller and 20 - 100 times faster, so we minimize the size of the data we're sending between the client and server and are also able to do it much faster.

\section{Resources Wasted}

As mentioned in the implementation section, the entire \textit{Meteor} framework assumes objects are being passed around as JSON objects. This means we had to do added work to incorporate Protocol Buffers. First, before we send data, we have to convert a JSON object into a Protocol Buffer object and then serialize it. When we receive data, we have to deserialize the data, convert it to a Protocol Buffer object, then convert it to a JSON object for use after. Because we do both of these operations for everything sent between the client and server, we do have a performance hit in this area. However, the application is still fast enough to the point where this seems to be unnoticeable.

\section{Failure Conditions}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Failstops
	
	A failstop could occur in our system anytime the server goes down. Thanks to \textit{Meteor's} technologies the client will be notified within seconds if the server goes down and will display the message "Trying to connect. There seems to be a connection issue".
	
	\item Byzantine Failures
	
	The correctness of our code is unproven, so while we are unaware of where a byzantine failure may occur, we recognize that such a failure is theoretically possible in our system.
	
	\item Receive, Send, and General Omissions
	
	The client and server are always kept up-to-date with each other thanks to \textit{Meteor's} technologies, so any change that happens on either end will be pushed to the other party. In other words, we expect no omissions to occur. 
\end{itemize}	


\section{Approach Comparison} 

First, let's look at the benefits of REST over Protocol Buffers. One major pro of the former is its flexibility and lack of complexity. Protocol Buffers require a system to predefine the format of the data before hand, making it a very static protocol. On the other hand, with REST one can just hit an endpoint and get back data in whatever format is specified at that endpoint. Furthermore this means the organization of an API can be changed drastically without any modifications of the clients.

Now let's look at the pros of Protocol Buffers. In a RESTful design paradigm, it is not possible to establish a persistent connection between client and server using HTTP without the use of WebSockets. This means no server driven events and that the client must repeatedly send the server requests, asking if anything has updated. In comparison, Protocol Buffers just affect how the data is transmitted, meaning if a framework like \textit{Meteor} is used, the client can continually be updated with server driven events. Secondly, in a RESTful design paradigm, a client can continually wait for a response from a server that may be down. Since Protocol Buffers are just a way of serializing data, this can be avoided by standard practices. Furthermore, Protocol Buffers of significantly compress the data being sent, especially in comparison to JSON or XML.
